When first attempting a music search it will require a login to a Spotify account.  
After agreeing to the use of the user's Spotify account the functionality will be available.  
  
Music artists, tracks, etc. can be searched via the Spotify API and show the in results pane.  
These results can be added to a playlist, which can be named and saved to the user's Spotify account.
